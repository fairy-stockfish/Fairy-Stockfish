  // append_changed_indices() : get a list of indices for recently changed features

  // IMPORTANT: The `pos` in this function is pretty much useless as it
  // is not always the position the features are updated to. The feature
  // transformer code right now can update multiple accumulators per move,
  // but since Stockfish only keeps the full state of the current leaf
  // search position it is not possible to always pass here the position for
  // which the accumulator is being updated. Therefore the only thing that
  // can be reliably extracted from `pos` is the king square for the king
  // of the `perspective` color (note: not even the other king's square will
  // match reality in all cases, this is also the reason why `dp` is passed
  // as a parameter and not extracted from pos.state()). This is of particular
  // problem for future nets with other feature sets, where updating the active
  // feature might require more information from the intermediate positions. In
  // this case the only easy solution is to remove the multiple updates from
  // the feature transformer update code and only update the accumulator for
  // the current leaf position (the position after the move).
