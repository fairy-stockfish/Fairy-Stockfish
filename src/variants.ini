# This is a configuration file to add user-defined variants to Fairy-Stockfish.

################################################
### Usage:
# Add "load" and the file path to the SF call (e.g., "./stockfish load variants.ini")
# or set the UCI option "VariantPath" to the path of this file in order to load it.
# In order to validate the configuration without actually loading the variants
# run "./stockfish check variants.ini", which reports potential config errors.

################################################
### Variant configuration:
# The variant name needs to be specified as a section in square brackets,
# followed by its rule configurations as key-value pairs as described below.
# If you encounter problems configuring variants, please report them at:
# https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish/issues

### Inheritance
# If a variant is similar to a previously defined variant,
# inheritance can be used to simplify the definition. To inherit from the
# configuration of an existing variant, specify the parent variant after the child
# variant name separated by a colon, e.g., [gothic:capablanca].
# When inheritance is used, only the differences to the parent variant need to be defined,
# see the examples in this file, e.g., 3check-crazyhouse.
# When no inheritance is used, the default template applies,
# which is basically standard chess but without any predefined pieces.

### Piece types
# Firstly, the piece types for a variant need to be defined.
# For that, specify the letter used for each piece type, e.g.:
# pawn = p
#
# See the list below for all available piece types:
# pawn
# knight
# bishop
# rook
# queen
# fers
# alfil
# fers_alfil (=fers+alfil)
# silver
# aiwok (=rook+knight+fers)
# bers (=rook+fers)
# archbishop (=bishop+knight)
# chancellor (=rook+knight)
# amazon (=queen+knight)
# knibis
# biskni
# kniroo
# rookni
# shogi_pawn
# lance
# shogi_knight
# euroshogi_knight
# gold
# dragon_horse
# clobber
# breakthrough
# immobile (piece without moves)
# cannon
# soldier
# horse
# elephant
# banner (=rook+cannon+horse)
# wazir
# commoner (non-royal king)
# centaur (=knight+commoner)
# king

### Option types
# [bool]: boolean flag to enable/disable a feature [true, false]
# [Rank]: denotes a rank of the board [1-10]
# [File]: denotes a file of the board [1-12, a-i]
# [int]: any natural number [0, 1, ...]
# [PieceType]: a piece type [letters defined for pieces, e.g., p]
# [Bitboard]: list of squares [e.g., d4 e4 d5 e5]. * can be used as wildcard for files (e.g., *1 is the first rank)
# [Value]: game result for the side to move [win, loss, draw]
# [CountingRule]: makruk or ASEAN counting rules [makruk, asean, none]
