# This is a configuration file to add user-defined variants to Fairy-Stockfish.

################################################
### Usage:
# Add "load" and the file path to the SF call (e.g., "stockfish.exe load variants.ini")
# or set the UCI option "VariantPath" to the path of this file in order to load it.
# In order to validate the configuration without actually loading the variants
# run "stockfish.exe check variants.ini", which reports potential config errors.

################################################
### Variant configuration:
# The variant name needs to be specified as a section in square brackets,
# followed by its rule configurations as key-value pairs as described below.
# If you encounter problems configuring variants, please report them at:
# https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish/issues

### Inheritance
# If a variant is similar to a previously defined variant,
# inheritance can be used to simplify the definition. To inherit from the
# configuration of an existing variant, specify the parent variant after the child
# variant name separated by a colon, e.g., [gothic:capablanca].
# When inheritance is used, only the differences to the parent variant need to be defined,
# see the examples in this file, e.g., 3check-crazyhouse.
# When no inheritance is used, the default template applies,
# which is basically standard chess but without any predefined pieces.

### Piece types
# Firstly, the piece types for a variant need to be defined.
# For that, specify the letter used for each piece type, e.g.:
# pawn = p
#
# See the list below for all available predefined piece types (and their Betza notation):
# pawn (fmWfceF)
# knight (N)
# bishop (B)
# rook (R)
# queen (Q)
# fers (F)
# alfil (A)
# fersAlfil (FA)
# silver (FfW)
# aiwok (RNF)
# bers (RF)
# archbishop (BN)
# chancellor (RN)
# amazon (QN)
# knibis (mNcB)
# biskni (mBcN)
# kniroo (mNcR)
# rookni (mRcN)
# shogiPawn (fW)
# lance (fR)
# shogiKnight (fN)
# gold (WfF)
# dragonHorse (BW)
# clobber (cW)
# breakthrough (fmWfF)
# immobile ()
# cannon (mRcpR)
# janggiCannon (pR)
# soldier (fsW)
# horse (nN)
# elephant (nA)
# janggiElephant (nZ)
# banner (RcpRnN)
# wazir (W)
# commoner (K)
# centaur (KN)
# king (K)

### Custom pieces
# Custom pieces can be defined by using one of the available slots:
# customPiece1, customPiece2, ..., customPiece26
# E.g., pawns without double steps could be described as:
# customPiece1 = p:mfWcfF
#
# You can define custom king movements in the same way you can define another custom piece.
# E.g., to make the king move like a centaur:
# king = k:KN
# In constrast to other custom pieces the Betza notation for the king is optional though
# and defaults to a standard chess king (betza: K) when skipped, e.g.:
# king = k
#
# The movements of custom pieces can be defined using the Betza notation.
# https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/Betza.html
# In Fairy-Stockfish only a subset of Betza notation can be used. The supported features are:
# - all base moves/atoms (W, F, etc.)
# - all directional modifiers (f, b, etc.)
# - limited and unlimited distance sliders/riders for W/R, F/B, and N directions
# - hoppers and grasshoppers for W/R and F/B directions, i.e., pR, pB, gR, and gB
# - lame leapers (n) for N, A, and Z directions, i.e., nN, nA, and nZ

### Piece values
# The predefined and precalculated piece values can be overriden
# by specifying the pieceValueMg and pieceValueEg options, e.g.,
# pieceValueMg = p:150 n:800
# pieceValueEg = p:200 n:900
#
# For orientation, the internal predefined piece values can be found in types.h.
# A suitable piece for gauging the piece values is the rook, which internally has:
# pieceValueMg = r:1276
# pieceValueEg = r:1380

### Option types
# [bool]: boolean flag to enable/disable a feature [true, false]
# [Rank]: denotes a rank of the board [1-10]
# [File]: denotes a file of the board [1-12, a-i]
# [int]: any natural number [0, 1, ...]
# [PieceType]: a piece type [letters defined for pieces, e.g., p]
# [Bitboard]: list of squares [e.g., d4 e4 d5 e5]. * can be used as wildcard for files (e.g., *1 is the first rank)
# [Value]: game result for the side to move [win, loss, draw]
# [MaterialCounting]: material couting rules for adjudication [janggi, unweighted, whitedrawodds, blackdrawodds, none]
# [CountingRule]: makruk or ASEAN counting rules [makruk, asean, none]
# [EnclosingRule]: reversi or ataxx enclosing rules [reversi, ataxx, none]

### Additional options relevant for usage in Winboard/XBoard
# A few options only have the purpose of improving compatibility with Winboard/Xboard.
# These do not need to be specified when using other GUIs, but can be essential for Winboard/Xboard.
#
# variantTemplate: base variant to inherit GUI logic from [values: fairy, shogi, bughouse] (default: fairy)
