Fairy-Stockfish is a chess variant engine derived from [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/) designed for the support of fairy chess variants and easy extensibility with more games. It can play various regional, historical, and modern chess variants as well as [games with user-defined rules](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Variant-configuration). For [compatibility with graphical user interfaces](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Graphical-user-interfaces) it supports the UCI, UCCI, USI, UCI-cyclone, and CECP/XBoard protocols.

The goal of the project is to create an engine supporting a large variety of chess-like games, equipped with the powerful search of Stockfish. Despite its generality the [playing strength](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Playing-strength) is on a very high level in almost all supported variants. Due to its multi-protocol support Fairy-Stockfish works with almost any chess variant GUI.

## Installation
You can download the [Windows executable](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/releases/latest/download/fairy-stockfish-largeboard_x86-64.exe) or [Linux binary](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/releases/latest/download/fairy-stockfish-largeboard_x86-64) from the [latest release](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/releases/latest) or [compile the program from source](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish#compiling-stockfish-yourself-from-the-sources). The program comes without a graphical user interface, so you perhaps want to use it together with a [compatible GUI](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Graphical-user-interfaces), or [play against it online](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Online) at [pychess](https://www.pychess.org/), [lishogi](https://lishogi.org/@/Fairy-Stockfish), or [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/Fairy-Stockfish). Read more about [how to use](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/Usage) Fairy-Stockfish in the wiki.

If you want to preview the functionality of Fairy-Stockfish before downloading, you can try it out on the [Fairy-Stockfish playground](https://fairyground.vercel.app/) in the browser.

Optional NNUE evaluation parameter files to improve playing strength for many variants are in the [list of NNUE networks](https://fairy-stockfish.github.io/nnue/#current-best-nnue-networks).
For the regional variants Xiangqi, Janggi, and Makruk [dedicated releases with built-in NNUE networks](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish-NNUE) are available. See the [wiki](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki/NNUE) for more details on NNUE.

## Help

See the [Fairy-Stockfish Wiki](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/wiki) for more info, or if the required information is not available, open an [issue](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/issues) or join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/FYUGgmCFB4).

## Bindings

Besides the C++ engine, this project also includes bindings for other programming languages in order to be able to use it as a library for chess variants. They support move, SAN, and FEN generation, as well as checking of game end conditions for all variants supported by Fairy-Stockfish. Since the bindings are using the C++ code, they are very performant compared to libraries directly written in the respective target language.

### Python

The python binding [pyffish](https://pypi.org/project/pyffish/) contributed by [@gbtami](https://github.com/gbtami) is implemented in [pyffish.cpp](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/blob/master/src/pyffish.cpp). It is e.g. used in the backend for the [pychess server](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants).

### Lua

The Lua bindings provide a powerful interface to the chess variant engine. They require Lua 5.1 for LuaJIT compatibility. See [tests/lua/README.md](tests/lua/README.md) for installation and usage instructions.

### Javascript

The javascript binding [ffish.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffish) contributed by [@QueensGambit](https://github.com/QueensGambit) is implemented in [ffishjs.cpp](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/blob/master/src/ffishjs.cpp). The compilation/binding to javascript is done using emscripten, see the [readme](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish/tree/master/tests/js).

## Ports

### WebAssembly

For in-browser use a [port of Fairy-Stockfish to WebAssembly](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/fairy-stockfish.wasm) is available at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fairy-stockfish-nnue.wasm). It is e.g. used for local analysis on [pychess.org](https://www.pychess.org/analysis/chess). Also see the [Fairy-Stockfish WASM demo](https://github.com/ianfab/fairy-stockfish-nnue-wasm-demo) available at https://fairy-stockfish-nnue-wasm.vercel.app/.
